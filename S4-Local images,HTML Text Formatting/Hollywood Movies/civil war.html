    <p>Civil War is a 2024 dystopian thriller film written and 
    directed by Alex Garland, starring Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura,
     Cailee Spaeny, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Sonoya Mizuno,
     and Nick Offerman.
     The plot follows a team of war journalists traveling from New
     York City to Washington, D.C. during a civil war fought across
     the United States between a despotic federal government and 
     secessionist movements, to interview the president before 
     rebels take the capital city.
     Principal photography began in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2022,
     with production moving to London later in the year.
     Civil War premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 
     2024, and was theatrically released in the United States
     by A24 and in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film 
     Distributors on April 12, 2024. With a budget of $50 million,
     Civil War is A24's most expensive film to date.
     The film has grossed over $122 million worldwide, becoming
     A24's second highest-grossing film, and received generally
     positive reviews from critics. </p>

      <p>Foreign enlistment in the American Civil War 
        (1861â€“1865) reflected the conflict's international 
        significance among both governments and their citizenry.
     Diplomatic and popular interest were aroused by the United States'
     status as a nascent power at the time, and by the war's central
     cause being the globally divisive issue of slavery.
     Consequently, many men enlisted from abroad and among
     immigrant communities in the U.S.When hostilities first broke out,
     roughly 13% of Americans were foreign-born, the vast majority 
     concentrated in northern cities; subsequently, foreign enlistment 
     largely favored the Union, which was also far more successful 
     at attracting volunteers.</p>
